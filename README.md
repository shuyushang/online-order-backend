# Back End of the Online Food Ordering System 

A React, Spring, and Hibernate Based Online Food Ordering System

## Description

* Implemented Rest API via Spring MVC, including customer sign-up/sign-in, restaurant/menu selecting, food ordering, shopping cart checkout, etc.
* Utilized ReactJS and various Ant Design components, e.g., Button, List, Form, Drawer, Modal, etc., to provide users with an interactive UI.
* Utilized Hibernate to access and map the data storage (menu, restaurants etc.).
* Provided both authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from malicious attacks.
* Deployed the application to Amazon Web Service.
